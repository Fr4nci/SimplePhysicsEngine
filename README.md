# Scripts and notes I'm creating while coding a Physics Engine in C/C++

In this repo, i will upload some scripts and some notes i wrote about the development of a Phyisics Engine
I'm still currently working on this. Let me know if you find some issues or maybe there are some improvement that could be made to make the code more efficient.
